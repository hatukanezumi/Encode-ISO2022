NAME
    Encode::ISO2022 - ISO/IEC 2022 character encoding scheme

SYNOPSIS
      package FooEncoding;
      use Encode::ISO2022;
      our @ISA = qw(Encode::ISO2022);
  
      $Encode::Encoding{'foo-encoding'} = bless {
        Name => 'foo-encoding',
        CCS => [ {...CCS #1...}, {...CCS #2...}, ....]
      } => __PACKAGE__;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a character encoding scheme (CES) switching a set
    of multiple coded character sets (CCS).

    Instances of Encode::ISO2022 have following hash items.

    Name => STRING
        The name of this encoding as Encode::Encoding object.

    CCS => [ FEATURE, FEATURE, ...]
        List of features defining CCSs used by this encoding. Each item is a
        hash reference containing following items.

        bytes => NUMBER
            Number of bytes to represent each character. Default is 1.

        dec_only => BOOLEAN
            If true value is set, this CCS will be used only for decoding.

        encoding => ENCODING
            Encode::Encoding object used as CCS. Mandatory.

            Encodings used for CCS must provide "raw" conversion. Namely,
            they must be stateless and fixed-length conversion over 94^n or
            96^n code tables. Encode::ISO2022::CCS lists available CCSs.

        gr => BOOLEAN
            If true value is set, each character will be invoked to GR.

        g => STRING
        g_init => STRING
            Working set this CCS may be designated to: 'g0', 'g1', 'g2' or
            'g3'.

            If "g_init" is set, this CCS will be designated at beginning of
            coversion implicitly, and at end of conversion explicitly.

            If "g" or "g_init" is set and neither of "ls" nor "ss" is not
            set, this CCS will be invoked when it is designated.

            If neither of "g", "g_init", "ls" nor "ss" is set, this CCS is
            invoked always.

        g_seq => STRING
            Escape sequence to designate this CCS, if it can be designated
            explicitly.

        ls => STRING
        ss => STRING
            Escape sequence or control character to invoke this CCS, if it
            should be invoked explicitly.

            If "ss" is set, this CCS will be invoked for only one character.

    LineInit => BOOLEAN
        If it is true, designation and invokation states will be initialized
        at beginning of lines.

    SubChar => STRING
        Unicode string to be used for substitution character.
